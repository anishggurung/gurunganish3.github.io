                    On August 24, 2019, Saturday we the class 12 boarders took part in social awareness programme of “Go Green” in D Block Park Sector 57 Gurugram along with the kids of a school run by “Bhagat Foundation NGO for Child Education”.  </p>
                
                <p>It was indeed an enlightening day and a welcome break from a routine lazy Saturday when we boarded our bus early at 8:00 am. First we went directly to the school to pick up the kids from the NGO School. The excitement of the kids upon boarding our bus is worth mentioning as we were told that they had never experienced an AC bus before. We were happy to see the reaction of the kids but at the same time thoughtful that our large populations are still deprived of the necessities of life.
                </p>

                <p>

                </p>

               <p>The bus took us all to the nearby park. For many of us going on a tree plantation drive was new. We got exposure to how farmers plant trees using shovels and spades successfully planting 52 trees. We the group of 15 students was divided into 2 groups where half of us were planting trees and the others catering to 90 kids of the NGO with sweets, drinks, chips. We also entertained the kids by dancing and playing games around the park. The kids were really energetic and we also taught them the importance of growing trees on our planet.

                    </p>

               <p> Serving the food was really fun and inspiring teaching us life lessons such as cutting fruits with a knife, pouring drinks into glasses and make sure everyone gets an equal amount of food. Dancing together on their folk songs were quite amusing. We also held huge posters on saving our planet by growing tees. Digging deep in the ground using heavy shovels and spades was first time experience for many of us. We had teamed up ourselves where some of us got water, some digging the ground and planting the trees. It was really a pleasure looking at everyone involved in their designated duties in such sweltering sunlight. Introducing each other and listening to their life stories was really heart touching. The members of the NGO including our house parents and DHM Mrs. Shahnaz Banoo Butt were really cooperative and supportive. Towards the end of the occasion, it was really hard to say goodbye to the adorable kids and would definitely love to come back again for more social work. We successfully managed to spread the social awareness of “Go Green”, plant more trees and prevent deforestation.</p>
