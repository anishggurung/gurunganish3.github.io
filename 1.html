                <p class="lead">Technology advancement has evolved so much from the past 10 years and totally changed the way people interact to the world.It has changed  many aspects such as way of communicating, spending free times in your cell phones or ipads , way of how products are manufactured (using programmed robots) and many more. </p>
                
                <p>I do remember when I was a kid, I used to watch people washing up their clothes in the veranda all day in such tampering sunlight rubbing the clothes and washing it again and again. But now I see those same people using microprocessed washing machines and are able to spend their time more efficiently.Not just washing machines, I see a total different world in front of me than what I used to see. Childrens and adults stick to their cell phones all day long. People rely on technology all the way from cooking food to washing the clothes.

                <h2>Trending in Market Right now</h2>

                <p>Introduction to Robotics have immensely impacted people and their daily life. In fact even the introduction to new softwares available today effectively help doing works. Technology has been today a drug for people and even young generations starting off in their young school days start learning concepts on technology. People are so confident that this might take a huge role in the coming years.</p>

                <blockquote><p>With innovation and technology,seems we have forgotten to cherish the true beauty the world has to offer.  ("A.C Van Cherub")</p></blockquote>

                <p>According to the recent statistics the usage of technology from inclusive both younger and older generation are newly emerging naratives. Teachers also prefer teaching students through the help of laptops or ipads to be more interactive session due to special animations and graphical learning giving a broader understanding.Social media platforms like facebook,snapchat,instagram are getting popular day by day simplyfying the means of communications.</p>

                <h3>New Innovations</h3>

                <p>There are huge number of people and multinational businesses working on innovating ideas. China, United States, Japan are some of the popular countries working on these sectors and convince people to dream a totally different world in the coming years. The stimulation to the real world using Argumented Reality also crazes the people. Today car companies have started working on self drive motors excessively cutting down human work. Space companies such as "Space X" are even planning out to establish a human colony in mars in the near future by developing classified rockets.Some of the interesting innovations include:

<pre><code>
{
    Magic Leap - Development of 3D Design
    Nano-Architecture - Making Stong and light materials
    Car-to-Car Communication - Driveless cars
    Project Loon - Worldwide wireless carrier through baloons
    Liquid Biopsy - Detect diseases early and fight against diseases.

}
</code></pre>

                <p>These are some of the great inventions we can expect in coming years in such growing society.Today no business or no school can run with the help of IT System. Although IT doesnt just bring out benefits to the society and indeed have many Drawbacks.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>Robotics in factories,Complex Security systems have completely eased out the human job and have the ability to work 24/7. New aplications and softwares are been developed everyday and thus we hope to see more advanced use of Technology in the upcoming future..</p>
